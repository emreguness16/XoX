# XoX
The purpose of this project is to develop a XoX game coded in C#. The feature of passing the turn between players adds a new dimension to the game beyond its 
standard features. 
This feature can be saved even when the application is restarted by using an internal database.
If you are starting the application for the first time and the player order is not visible, please continue playing. The issue will be resolved automatically. 
If you have any bproblems, you can contact emre_gunes1288@outlook.com.
